# Context

The 2020 assessment for Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) in British Columbia (BC) found the Area 3CD stock (West Coast Vancouver Island: WCVI; Figure \@ref(fig:fig-map)) to be in the Cautious Zone with 97--98% probability, with 2--10% probability of being in the Critical Zone, over all catch scenarios considered [@dfo2021].
This followed a notable reduction in the 2018 WCVI synoptic bottom trawl survey index (approximately 26--27% of the 2014 and 2016 observations (Table \@ref(tab:surv-canadian-table); Figure \@ref(fig:fig-surv-canadian))).
Given the low index point in 2018, the 2020 Science Response recommended updating the assessment following the 2020 WCVI synoptic bottom trawl survey.
However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the scheduled 2020 WCVI survey was postponed to 2021, returning to its regular biennial schedule in 2022.
Both the 2021 and 2022 index points were lower than the 2018 observation (Table \@ref(tab:surv-canadian-table)).
Catches since 2018 have also been lower than in previous years (Table \@ref(tab:tab-catch-3cd); Figure \@ref(fig:fig-catch-3cd)).
The commercial catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) index decreased substantially in 2018 but has since increased, following increases in commercial catch (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-summary-cpue-indices-3cd)).

A Request for Science Information and Advice (RSIA) for Pacific Cod was issued in 2022 for both the 3CD and 5ABCD (Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound) stocks.
The stock assessment model (see Analysis and Response) is fitted to commercial and survey indices of abundance, commercial catch, and an index of mean weight, derived from commercial length samples [@forrest2020].
However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent shift towards at-sea electronic monitoring, there has been no at-sea biological sampling on commercial trawl vessels since 2019.
This change follows a trend of reduced biological length sampling of Pacific Cod on commercial vessels that began around 2015 (Appendix A).

The 2022 RSIA therefore had two steps: 1) an assessment of the potential sensitivity of the stock assessment to missing length data from the commercial fishery; and 2) a stock status update with updated catch advice for both stocks.
The RSIA advised to only proceed to Step 2 if the missing length data were "deemed to not be of significance to the quality and rigour of the scientific advice".
Using the 2020 assessment model, the authors presented several sensitivity analyses to the Pacific Cod Technical Working Group (TWG) to evaluate alternative methods for updating the commercial mean weight index.
This included a generalized linear model (GLM) for predicting the commercial mean weight index from a survey mean weight index derived from WCVI survey samples.
The TWG found that the GLM provided acceptable predictions of the commercial mean weight index for the Area 3CD stock.
However, the TWG decided that a similar GLM applied to the 5ABCD stock did not produce predictions consistent enough with the commercial mean weight index in overlapping years to be used in an assessment.
Because of this issue with the 5ABCD commercial mean weight index and limited staff resources, Step 2 did not proceed.

The Pacific Groundfish Management Unit has not requested updated catch advice for 2023.
However, given the three low index points in 2018, 2021, and 2022, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Science Branch has issued a RSIA requesting a stock status update for the Area 3CD stock to ensure all three of these index points are considered in a timely evaluation of stock status.
While the last assessment found that there was low probability (2%--10%) of the stock falling below its limit reference point (LRP) in 2022 under all considered catch scenarios [@dfo2021], the stock has failed to rebound under low estimated fishing mortality rates.

The Fish Stocks provisions (FSP) of Canada's [*Fisheries Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-14/page-2.html#h-1175547) require that a rebuilding plan be developed for major fish stocks that have declined to or below their LRP.
While the FSP only apply to major stocks prescribed in the *Fishery (General) Regulations*, [guidance](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/precautionary-precaution-eng.htm#toc_2.1) has been provided that states that, for stocks not subject to the FSP (such as Pacific Cod), DFO's Precautionary Approach (PA) Policy [@dfo2009] still applies:

*"[...] under the [PA] policy, the requirement to develop a rebuilding plan is triggered once the stock declines to, or below, its LRP. However, in keeping with the 2009 PA Policy, if a fish stock is decreasing and approaching the LRP, management measures must encourage stock growth and arrest preventable declines, and the development of a rebuilding plan should be initiated sufficiently in advance to ensure that the plan is ready to be implemented if a stock declines to its LRP."*

For the purpose of triggering a rebuilding plan, the guidance provides the following definitions of whether a stock is at or below its LRP:

*"[A stock] is considered to be at or below its LRP if the terminal year stock status indicator is estimated to be at or below the LRP with a greater than 50% probability or if the projected stock status indicator falls below the LRP with a greater than 50% probability under a zero catch scenario in a 1-year projection, unless an alternative method or probability is defined in a stock-specific precautionary approach framework."*

This Science Response reports results from the Science Response Process of October 20, 2023, on the "Stock Status Update of British Columbia Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) in Area 3CD in 2023".
Since there has been no request for catch advice, this is a stock status update only. The update uses the same model configurations as the 2018 and 2020 assessments [@forrest2020; @dfo2021], including model-averaged stock status based on the same seven sensitivity scenarios as in 2018 and 2020.
Due to the ongoing absence of commercial length samples, this update uses the GLM developed in 2022 to update the last five years of the annual commercial mean weight index, based on values from a new survey mean weight index.
The survey mean weight index and the GLM are described in Appendices B and C.

# Background

Pacific Cod (or Grey Cod) is a relatively short-lived (~10--13 *y*), fast-growing member of the family Gadidae.
It is distributed throughout the North Pacific Ocean, and throughout the waters of BC, typically in depth ranges up to 200 m. 
Four stocks of Pacific Cod are defined for management purposes on the BC coast: Strait of Georgia (4B), West Coast Vancouver Island (3CD), Queen Charlotte Sound (5AB), and Hecate Strait (5CD) (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-map)).
This document provides a stock status update for the 3CD stock only. 

## Description of the fishery

Pacific Cod in BC are caught almost entirely in the groundfish bottom trawl fishery, mainly in 50--200 m depth zones [@forrest2020].
Most catch is taken in Area 5CD [@forrest2020], with smaller catches from Areas 5AB and 3CD, with near negligible catch taken from the west coast of Haida Gwaii, Area 5E (< 0.5% of total average annual catch since 1985).
Pacific Cod are also caught in small quantities in the groundfish longline fishery (around 0.5% of the total annual catch on average).

The BC groundfish integrated fishery, which includes the bottom trawl fishery, is subject to 100% at-sea and dockside monitoring [@dfo2023].
Between 1996 and 2019, all bottom trawl vessels carried observers who recorded the catch of each species and estimated quantities of released (discarded) fish.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the fishery has shifted towards electronic monitoring on trawl vessels, which has impacted the availability of commercial biological samples (Appendix A).

# Analysis and Response

## Data

Data were extracted from DFO databases using methods described in @forrest2020.
Data from fishery-independent and commercial fishery sources were available up until March 31, 2023 and all time series were updated using currently available data.
Minor differences in the time series compared to those presented in previous assessments are due to routine updates and corrections in the databases.

For each area, models were fit to the following data: commercial catch, fishery-independent indices of abundance, commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE), and an index of mean weight of fish in the commercial catch.

### Commercial catch

Commercial catch data (Table \@ref(tab:tab-catch-3cd) and Figure \@ref(fig:fig-catch-3cd) were extracted from three different databases held by DFO: *GFCatch* (Canadian trawl landings, 1954--1995); *PacHarvTrawl* (Canadian trawl landings, 1996 to March 31, 2007); and *GFFOS* (Canadian trawl landings, April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2022).
Catch data prior to 1981 include catch by US vessels [@forrest2020].
Fishing years are defined as beginning on April 1 for all years, and are referenced by starting year, e.g., the fishing year 1957 runs from April 1, 1957 to March 31, 1958.

Prior to the introduction of at-sea observers in 1996, estimates of discards were obtained from fishing logbooks.
Pre-1996 discards are therefore a major source of uncertainty in this assessment.
Estimates in years following the introduction of 100% at-sea monitoring in 1996 are considered to be accurate.
Pacific Cod can be legally discarded by trawlers in BC.
However, between 1996 and 2019, on-board observers first estimated the quantity being discarded and this was counted against the vessel's quota.
Discard estimates are still counted against the vessel's quota, but the estimates are now made via the electronic monitoring system and fisher logbooks [@dfo2023].
In addition to providing greater accuracy in reporting of discards since 1996, counting discards against the vessel's quota provides greater incentives to avoid discarding.

### Canadian bottom trawl surveys

Survey indices (Table \@ref(tab:surv-canadian-table) and Figure \@ref(fig:fig-surv-canadian)) were calculated using a swept area analysis (a stratified random analysis), documented in Appendix A of @forrest2020.
Abundance in Area 3CD (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-map)) is indexed by the WCVI synoptic bottom trawl survey.
The survey was first conducted in 2004 and is conducted in alternating (even-numbered) years.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 survey was postponed to 2021 then resumed its even-numbered years schedule in 2022.

For comparison, survey indices in Queen Charlotte Sound and Hecate Strait are also shown in (Table \@ref(tab:surv-canadian-table) and Figure \@ref(fig:fig-surv-canadian)).

### NMFS Triennial Survey (in Canadian waters) {#nmfs-survey}

An additional relative abundance index for Area 3CD was developed using data from the
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Triennial survey, which operated off the lower half of WCVI between 1980 and 2001 (Figure \@ref(fig:tri-fig9)).
See Appendix A of @forrest2020 for details.

### Commercial CPUE

Standardized commercial CPUE indices were developed for the historical (1956--1995) and modern (1996--2019) periods (Figure  \@ref(fig:fig-summary-cpue-indices-3cd)).
The indices were developed using a Tweedie generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM) described in detail in Appendix B of @forrest2020.
The historical-period GLMMs included predictors for depth, locality, month, and a locality-year interaction.
The modern-period GLMMs included predictors for depth, latitude, locality, month, vessel, and a locality-year interaction.

### Commercial mean weight index

The commercial mean weight index between 1956 and 2016 was calculated using commercial length samples, with the methodology described in Appendix C of @forrest2020.
Commercial biological samples were available for calculating mean weight from 1956 to 2019 (excluding 2018).

There has been no biological sampling on commercial trawl vessels since 2019, and a decline in commercial sampling of Pacific Cod that began around 2015 (Appendix A).
In Area 3CD, only four biological samples were taken in 2017 (total 300 fish), no samples were taken in 2018, and only two samples were taken in 2019 (total 360 fish).
The samples in 2017 and 2019 were taken from a limited area, especially in 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sample-locations)).
The 2017 mean weight value was anomalously high (3.024 kg) and, given that it was only based on four samples, it was not used in the 2018 or 2020 stock assessments [@forrest2020; @dfo2021].
Due to lack of data, the 2020 assessment used the 2019 mean weight value for both 2019 and 2020, although this approach was not ideal, as the 2019 index point was based on only two samples from the same location.

In the absence of representative biological samples for the last years of the index, a GLM was developed to predict the commercial mean weight index from a mean weight index derived from length samples from WCVI synoptic survey (Appendices B and C).

The GLM predicts values for the commercial mean weight index only for years when there was a survey (i.e., predicted commercial index values were generated for even-numbered years from 2004 to 2018, then 2021 and 2022; Appendix C: Figure \@ref(fig:all-mean-weight-series-3cd)).
Therefore, a decision had to be made about how to include the GLM-derived index values, since there were no GLM-derived values for 2017, 2019 or 2020.

For consistency with previous assessments, the decision was to use the commercial mean weight index derived directly from commercial length samples for the years 1956--2016.
Since neither of the previous assessments have used the 2017 index point, it was also omitted from this assessment update.
For 2018--2022, the model uses the 2018, 2021 and 2022 mean weight index values derived from the GLM (Appendix C: Figure \@ref(fig:all-mean-weight-series-3cd)).
Values for 2019 and 2020 were interpolated between 2018 and 2021 (Appendix D: Table \@ref(tab:tab-mean-weight-recent-3cd), Sc. 1 Reference).
See Appendix D for a brief presentation of model sensitivity to these choices.

## Stock assessment model

The stock assessment model is a Bayesian delay-difference model [@deriso1980], fit to survey indices, commercial CPUE indices, commercial catch data, and the commercial mean weight index.
The model is fully described in Appendix D of @forrest2020.
All fixed parameters and prior probability distributions for model parameters in the current assessment were the same as those reported in @forrest2020.

Joint posterior distributions were numerically approximated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routines built into AD Model Builder (Metropolis-Hastings algorithm) [@fournier2012]. 
Posterior samples were drawn every 5,000 iterations from a chain of length 10 million, resulting in 2,000 posterior samples. The first 1,000 of these samples were dropped to allow for sufficient burn-in.

## Reference points

The DFO Fishery Decision-making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (PA) Policy [@dfo2009] requires stock status to be characterized using three reference points:

1. An Upper Stock Reference point, USR;
2. A Limit Reference Point, LRP; and
3. A Limit Removal Rate, LRR.

The USR and LRP define the threshold of three biomass-based stock status zones defined under the PA Policy [@dfo2009]: Critical Zone (below the LRP); Cautious Zone (above the LRP and below the USR); and Healthy Zone (above the USR).

As in previous assessments [@dfo2019; @dfo2021], historical reference points were used to assess stock status, where:

1. The USR is the mean of the biomass estimates from 1956--2004.

2. The LRP is the lowest estimated biomass agreed upon as an undesirable state to be avoided. For Area 3CD this is the estimated biomass in 1986.

3. The LRR is the mean of the fishing mortality rate estimates from 1956--2004.

See @forrest2020 for the history of the choice to use historical reference points for Pacific Cod.
See also @forrest2018 for an evaluation of historical reference points for the 5CD stock of Pacific Cod.

## Model scenarios

A model-averaging approach was used to estimate stock status based on combined posterior samples from several sensitivity cases, as in the two previous assessments [@dfo2019; @dfo2021].
In a model-averaging approach, several models, each representing a different but plausible state of nature, were developed and the posterior samples were combined across all scenarios to provide the probabilities of stock status.
This approach captures the effects of key uncertainties and averages them into the results, as opposed to using a single best model with separate sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of uncertainties on the results.
Other stock assessments that have used a model-averaging approach are Pacific Cod in Areas 5AB and 5CD [@forrest2015], Pacific Hake [@stewart2011], Pacific Halibut [@stewart2016], BC Shortspine Thornyhead [@starr2017], BC Walleye Pollock [@starr2018] and several assessments of BC *Sebastes* stocks [e.g., @dfo2019b; @dfo2020a; @dfo2020b].

Major axes of uncertainty for Pacific cod are catchability ($q$) in the indices of abundance, the magnitude of natural mortality ($M$), age at recruitment to the fishery, and the magnitude of observation errors in the surveys and mean weight [@forrest2020].
A Reference model was first established to represent what were considered to be the most plausible model choices across a range of assumptions.
Key characteristics of the Reference model are provided in Table \@ref(tab:tab-param-table-3cd).
The Reference model served as the basis from which alternative scenarios were developed, altering key model assumptions one at a time.

The set of seven model scenarios for model-averaging was agreed upon at the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) Regional Peer Review (RPR) meeting in 2018 [@dfo2019].
The same set was used again in the 2020 stock assessment update [@dfo2021] and is used again here.
All models were updated with catch and index data to the end of the 2022 fishing year, with updates to the annual mean weight index described above.
Full details on the model configurations and assumptions for each scenario are provided in @forrest2020.

The scenarios (Sc) included in the model-averaging set were:

1.	Sc 1a: Reference model;
2.	Sc 2d: Set the mean of the prior probability distribution for synoptic survey $\ln(q)$ = $\ln(1.0)$, i.e., $\ln(q) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.3)$;
3.	Sc 2e: Increase the standard deviation (SD) for synoptic survey $\ln(q)$ to 0.6, i.e., $\ln(q) \sim \mathcal{N}(ln(0.228), 0.6)$;
4.	Sc 3a: Set the parameters of the prior probability distribution for $\ln(M) \sim \mathcal{N}(\ln(0.4),0.1)$;
5.	Sc 5a: Set knife-edged age at recruitment = 3 years;
6.	Sc 6b: Reduce the overall observation error term $\sigma_O = 0.15$; and
7.	Sc 7b: Reduce the SD in the likelihood for the fit to average annual mean weight $\sigma_W = 0.15$,

where scenario numbers reflect the original scenario numbers from the 2018 assessment [@forrest2020].

## Reference model results

Reference model results are presented to demonstrate model performance and to provide comparison with the 2020 stock assessment update.
Stock status, presented in the next section, is based on combined, averaged posterior model results.

Model convergence was informed by visual inspection of trace and autocorrelation plots (not shown), and two statistics: 1) the potential scale reduction statistic $\hat{R}$, which should approach 1.0 as the chains are consistent with convergence; and 2) the effective number of MCMC independent samples after accounting for autocorrelation $n_\mathrm{eff}$ [@gelman1992; @gelman2014].

Reference model parameter estimates are shown in Table \@ref(tab:tab-param-est-table-3cd).
Reference model fits to the data were generally typical of all sensitivity cases.
The model diagnostics were consistent with convergence, and posterior sample autocorrelation was relatively minor for most parameters (Table \@ref(tab:tab-param-est-table-3cd)).
Model fits to the catch were near perfect by design (standard deviation in log likelihood was set to 0.05) and are not shown.
Model fits to the four indices of abundance are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits-3cd).
The reference model followed the trends of the two fishery-independent indices (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits-3cd)a and d), but did not closely fit the 2012, 2014, and 2016 data points in the WCVI Synoptic survey (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits-3cd)a).
This lack of fit is likely because of large differences between low points (2012 and 2018) and high points (2014 and 2016) in the survey observations.
Similarly, while the model closely followed the major patterns in the historical CPUE index (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits-3cd)b), it did not capture all the peaks in the modern series (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-index-fits-3cd)c).
Fits such as this tend to occur when there is no other information (such as age composition data) to help resolve large fluctuations in observed indices.
@forrest2020 considered goodness of fit to the indices of abundance to be a primary driver of uncertainty in their assessments, as estimates of productivity parameters were sensitive to how well the model fit observed peaks in the indices.
They presented several sensitivity analyses to treatment of the observation error parameter $\sigma_O$, one of which is included in the model-averaging set here (Sc 6b).

As in the 2020  assessment [@dfo2021], the model tended to underestimate annual mean weight, especially in the early part of the time series (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-3cd)).
This result is most likely because most of the length measurements in this part of the time series came from fish classified as "keepers", i.e., landed (see @forrest2015 for discussion of this issue for the Area 5AB and 5CD stocks).
Smaller, discarded fish are therefore likely underrepresented in the annual mean weight data prior to the introduction of at-sea observers in 1996.
A scenario with a smaller value of $\sigma_W$, which controls the fit to the mean weight in the likelihood function, is included in the model-averaging set (Sc 7b).

## Sensitivity model results

Sensitivity of posterior recruitment estimates to the settings in the seven scenarios are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-recr-3cd-all-avg).
Sensitivity of posterior biomass estimates are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-biomass-3cd-all-avg).

As in previous assessments, the model was most sensitive to the assumed standard deviation in the prior for survey catchability ($q$) (Sc 2d).
The model was also sensitive to the assumed knife-edged age at recruitment (Sc 5a), in which recruitment was assumed to occur at age 3 instead of age 2. This scenario estimated the biomass to be lower than the other scenarios (Figure  \@ref(fig:fig-sens-biomass-3cd-all-avg)).

## Indicators of current stock status {#status}

Model-averaged posterior reference point estimates are provided in Table \@ref(tab:tab-ref-points-table-avg-3cd).
Model-averaged posterior estimates for biomass and fishing mortality are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-model-average-biomass-3cd) and \@ref(fig:fig-model-average-f-3cd), respectively.

While fishing mortality is estimated to be well below the limit removal reference, Table \@ref(tab:summary-tab-stock-status-avg-3cd) shows a 23% probability (i.e., about 1 out of 4 chance) that the biomass at the beginning of 2023 was below the LRP and >99% probability that the stock was below the USR. See also Figures \@ref(fig:fig-model-average-biomass-3cd-rel) and \@ref(fig:fig-model-average-p-lrp), noting that the models estimated just over 50% probability of the stock being below the LRP in 2021 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-model-average-p-lrp)).

Table \@ref(tab:summary-tab-projection-zero-avg-3cd) shows a 16% probability (i.e., about 3 out of 20 chance) that the stock would be below the LRP at the beginning of 2024 under a zero catch policy.

## Sources of uncertainty {#uncertainty}

Uncertainty due to estimated parameters and the weights assigned to various data components was explicitly addressed using a Bayesian approach.
For provision of advice, posterior results from seven alternative model configurations were combined to generate decision tables.
However, this approach only captures uncertainty associated with this set of model configurations and may underestimate greater structural uncertainties.
Additional uncertainties in this assessment stem from:

1. The lack of reliable age composition data for this species, which would provide additional information about recruitment strength, $M$, and gear selectivity. Reliable age composition data would also allow for better estimates of age at recruitment to the fishery;
1. Relatively short time series of fishery-independent abundance indices;
1. Uncertainty in the magnitude of pre-1996 discarding and foreign catches. Underestimation of historical discards could lead to an underestimation of stock productivity;
1. Bias in the length frequency data prior to 1996, due to likely under-representation of lengths of fish that were caught but released at sea;
1. A poor understanding of Pacific Cod stock structure in Pacific waters. For example, connectivity between stocks of Pacific Cod in BC and Alaska is not well understood. Pacific Cod stocks in the Gulf of Alaska have declined since 2017, likely due to warming north Pacific waters [@barbeaux2020; @laurel2023], and it is unknown whether there is any relationship between drivers of abundance of these stocks and stocks in BC; and
1. A poor understanding of the relationship between commercial CPUE data and abundance, and how this relationship has been affected over the course of management changes in the fishery.

# Conclusions {#conclusions}

Model-averaged estimates of biomass resulted in a 23% probability that the stock was below the LRP at the beginning of 2023, and a 16% probability that the stock would be below the LRP at the beginning of 2024 under zero catches.
Therefore, the stock does not currently meet the threshold of 50% probability of being below the LRP required under the rebuilding guidance to trigger a rebuilding plan (see Context) and is currently considered to be in the Cautious Zone under the PA policy.
However, these findings may invoke the requirement that "management measures must encourage stock growth and arrest preventable declines, and the development of a rebuilding plan should be initiated sufficiently in advance to ensure that the plan is ready to be implemented if a stock declines to its LRP."
Current fishing mortality is estimated to be low (< 0.02 $y^{-1}$) but increasing slightly, with an approximate 70% increase in commercial catch between 2021 and 2022.

There are uncertainties in the scale of the model-estimated biomass, given large uncertainties in survey catchability.
Reducing the estimated scale of the biomass would not necessarily influence the estimate of stock status, which is based on historical reference points that rescale with biomass.
However, estimates of fishing mortality would increase with lower estimates of biomass.

Other Pacific Cod populations (notably in Alaska) have undergone large declines since the marine heatwave of 2015 and 2016 [e.g., @barbeaux2020; @laurel2020].
However, survey indices of abundance in other areas of BC (Hecate Strait, Queen Charlotte Sound and West Coast Haida Gwaii) have not shown similar declines (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-surv-canadian)).
There has not been a thorough analysis of potential causes for the current decline in the Area 3CD Pacific Cod stock, which may be related to climate change-mediated effects on egg/larval/juvenile [@abookire2022; @laurel2023] or adult [@barbeaux2020] life stages, fish movement, fishing, or other factors.
We recommend that resources be allocated to investigate alternative hypotheses for changes in abundance of Pacific Cod in BC waters.

The loss of commercial biological samples from the commercial trawl fishery threatens the long-term viability of the current delay-difference model as a primary tool for assessing BC Pacific Cod populations.
Given the poor power of the GLM for predicting a commercial mean weight index for the Area 5ABCD population (DFO unpublished report), there is already no clear path forward for that stock.
We acknowledge that a new dockside biosampling program is currently in the pilot stage, with the intention expanding it to a full coastwide program following successful implementation of the pilot program.
While this is a welcome development, further analysis will be required to explore potential biases occurring due to continuing lack of samples from fish discarded at sea.
Therefore, in the ongoing absence of an at-sea commercial biological sampling program, we recommend resources be allocated to investigating and comparing other approaches for providing catch advice for Pacific Cod stocks, which may also be advantageous, given the uncertainties inherent in this model.
Alternative approaches may include length-based methods [e.g., @haist1995; @haist1998], or more data-limited approaches, such as adjusting annual total allowable catches (TACs) based on changes in the survey indices.
Versions of the latter approach are used by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) for data-limited (Category 3) stocks [@ices2022].
In Canada, survey-based data-limited methods have been simulation-tested in the Groundfish Management Procedure Framework [@anderson2021] and in @huynh2020.
Exploration of non-age structured models that allow for time-varying productivity [e.g., @mildenberger2019] may also be informative.

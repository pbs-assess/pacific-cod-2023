# Appendix B. Developing a survey mean weight index

## Methods

We followed the steps in Appendix C of @forrest2020, which described the methodology for weighting the commercial length samples to produce a commercial mean weight index, weighted by sequential quarter and catch weight.

We also adapted the approach for the West Coast Vancouver Island Synoptic Survey by replacing weighting by sequential quarter, which was done for the commercial samples, with weighting by depth stratum (Equations 3 and 4).
This was done because the survey is depth-stratified.

Note that for the survey mean weight index, we derived weights of individual fish from the measured lengths, using published length-weight parameters rather than using weights that were directly measured (Equation 1).
This was because far more fish were measured than were weighed.
This also follows the approach used for the commercial mean weight index.

The calculation of the survey mean weight index was done in the following steps. For simplicity, we have dropped year subscripts.

1. For each specimen $i$, in each Sample ID $j$, in each depth stratum $s$, convert individual length ($L_{i,j,s}$)  to weight ($W_{i,j,s}$):

\begin{equation}
{W_{i,j,s}} = \alpha{L_{i,j,s}}^{\beta}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constant length-weight parameters, where the values of the length-weight parameters are `r paste0("$\\alpha = ", .ALPHA3, "$")` and `r paste0("$\\beta = ", .BETA3, "$")`.

2. Calculate the mean weight ($W_j$) in each sample ID $j$, in each depth stratum $s$:

\begin{equation}
  {W_{j,s}} =  \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{j,s}}{{w_{i,j,s}}}}{{N_{j,s}}}
\end{equation}

where $N_{j,s}$ is the number of weights $W_{i,j,s}$ in sample ID $j$ and depth stratum $s$.

3. Calculate the mean weight ($W_s$) for each depth stratum $s$, weighted by the sample weights $S$:

\begin{equation}
{W_s} = \frac{{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{{N_s}} {{W_{j,s}S_{j,s}}}}}{{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{{N_s}} {{S_{j,s}}}}}
\end{equation}

where $N_s$ is the number of samples in depth stratum $s$.

4. Calculate the annual survey mean weight ($W$), weighted by the catch $C_s$ in each stratum $s$:

\begin{equation}
{W} = \frac{{\sum\limits_{s=1}^{{K}} {{W_sC_s}}}}{{\sum\limits_{s=1}^{{K}} {{C_s}}}}
\end{equation}

where $K$ is the number of depth strata surveyed in that year.

## Results

The commercial mean weight index, calculated using the method shown in Appendix C of @forrest2020 is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-comm-mean-weights-3cd), which indicates number of sampling events for each index year, as well as the two index values that were removed due to low sampling effort (2017 and 2019, see Appendix A).

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-3cd) shows the relationship between observed weights obtained by directly weighing individual fish vs weights calculated using Equation 1.
Figure \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd) shows the commercial mean weight index obtained from the methods described in @forrest2020, compared with the survey mean weight index obtained from Equations 1--4 here.
The number of sampling events is indicated by the sizes of the circles in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-comm-mean-weights-3cd) and \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd).

# Appendix C. Generalized Linear Model to predict commercial mean length index 

## Methods

We used a GLM with gamma-distributed observations and a log link [@mccullagh1989, p. 292], to estimate commercial mean weights ($y_t$) in year $t$ based on survey mean weights ($W_t$), calculated in Appendix B. Our model was fit as
\begin{align}
{y_t} \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\phi, \mu_t / \phi), \\
\log(\mu_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(W_t),
\end{align}

where $\mu_t$ represents the expected value at time $t$,
$\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ represent an intercept and slope,
$\phi$ represents the gamma shape parameter,
and the term $\mu_t / \phi$ represents the gamma scale.
The shape parameter can be reparameterized into the coefficient of variation (CV) as $\phi = 1 / \mathrm{CV}^2$ or $\mathrm{CV} = 1 / \sqrt{\phi}$.

## Results

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd-2) shows the commercial mean weight index plotted against the survey mean weight index, with the linear regression line.
The GLM estimated an intercept ($\beta_0$) of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.13--0.57), or 1.41 kg (95% CI: 1.14--1.76 kg) in natural space (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd-2)).
The model estimated $\beta_1$ as 0.75 (95% CI: 0.25--1.17), meaning a 1% increase in survey mean weight was associated with a 0.75% (95% CI: 0.25%--1.17%) increase in commercial mean weight (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd-2)).
The CV was estimated as 0.12.
A quantile-quantile plot of residuals transformed to have a Normal(0, 1) distribution if the model were consistent with the data did not reveal any substantial deviations from the expectation (Figure \@ref(fig:qqnorm-glm)).

Figure \@ref(fig:all-mean-weight-series-3cd) shows time series of all three series: the survey mean weight index, observed commercial mean weight index, and predicted mean weight index from the GLM, indicating good agreement between the commercial and survey mean weight indices.
The predicted commercial mean weights fit the observed commercial mean weights almost perfectly between 2004 and 2010, and in 2014.
The predictions underestimated the observed commercial index in 2012 and, following the survey trend, overestimated the commercial index in 2016.

# Appendix D. Model sensitivity to treatment of the mean weight index

Four scenarios were evaluated to investigate the sensitivity of the model to different treatments of the commercial annual mean weight index.
All models were based on the Area 3CD Reference Case model from the 2020 assessment [@dfo2021].
All scenarios used the commercial annual mean weight index derived from commercial length samples for the years 1956--2016.
There was no 2017 index point in any scenario, as in the 2020 assessment.

The four different scenarios are provided in the next section.

## Summary of the scenarios

Sc. 1: For 2018--2022, use the GLM predicted values for 2018, 2021 and 2022. Use linear interpolation between 2018 and 2021 to fill in values for 2019 and 2020.
This scenario was used as the basis for all models for evaluation of stock status in 2023 (see main body of this document).

Sc. 2: For 2018--2022, use the GLM predicted values for 2018, 2021 and 2022. Do not include interpolated values for 2019 and 2020.

Sc. 3: For the last seven years of the time series, use the same approach as in the 2020 assessment [@dfo2021], i.e, use the commercial mean weight index values for 2016, 2019 and 2020, where the 2020 value was set the same as the 2019 value. Continue to use the 2019 value for 2021 and 2022.

Sc. 4: Same as Sc. 3 but do not include any values for 2021 and 2022.

Values of the index since 2010 are provided in Table \@ref(tab:tab-mean-weight-recent-3cd)

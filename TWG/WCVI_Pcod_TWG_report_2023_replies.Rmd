## Section 1. 2017 index point

**Comment 1a. Section 2.1.5.** There is a contradiction in the 2nd paragraph in this section; it states “In Area 3CD, only four samples were taken in 2017 (total 300 fish), no samples were taken in 2018, and only two samples were taken in 2019 (total 360 fish). 
The 2017 mean weight value was anomalously high (3.024 kg) and, given that it was only based on two samples, it was not used in the 2020 stock assessment update (DFO 2021).
Due to lack of data, the 2020 assessment used the 2019 mean weight value for both 2019 and 2020, although this was not ideal, as the 2019 index point was also based on only two samples.” 
But according to Table 8, the 2017 sample was based on 4 samples, not 2. 

**Response:**

This was a typo that will be corrected in the Science Response.

**Comment 1b.** While I sympathise with excluding the 2017 estimate, dropping it simply because it was too high is potentially not a sound response. 

**Response:**

Since this Science Response will be an update, we made this choice to be consistent with the 2020 advice [@dfo2021].

However, we have run a scenario based on Scenario 1 in the TWG Report, which includes the 2017 value.
Comparisons between the model fit to the annual mean weight index in Scenario 1 (without 2017) and Scenario 2 (with 2017) are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-3cd) and \@ref(fig:fig-mean-weight-3cd-2017).
The model does not fit the 2017 value, similarly missing it and other very high mean weight index values.
As noted in previous Pacific Cod assessments, the model in general does not fit the mean weight index very well, especially in the early part of the time series where smaller fish are underrepresented in the data [@forrest2020].

The four samples collected in 2017, and the two samples collected in 2019, were collected from a limited area (see Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sample-locations)). The 2019 samples were collected from a single vessel.
In 2017, only 300 fish were measured across all four samples.
Given the obvious problems with basing index points on such limited samples, we don't think it is justified to further explore changing model parameters to fit the 2017 data point.

TODO: RUNNING SCENARIOS WITH sigW=0.15 AND WITH sigW=0.1

TODO: UPDATE THIS WITH RESULTS
Unpublished trials with smaller values of $\sigma_W$, the observation error term that influences the fit to the annual mean weight index, have resulted in much closer fits to the data in the early part of the time series, accompanied by a rescaling of the biomass, which we also feel is problematic due to known bias in the length samples prior to 1996 [@forrest2015].

## Section 2. Appendix B: Survey mean weight index

**Comment 2a i. Eq. 1.** Since this is a Bayesian analysis, shouldn’t we be including some uncertainty in the conversion of length to weight?

**Response:**

The length-weight parameter parameters were estimates taken directly from the 2018 Pacific cod update [@forrest2020]:

*“The models were fit as robust linear regressions: ln(Ws) = ln(a) + b · ln(Ls) with an M estimator (Venables and Ripley 2002). Robust linear models were chosen over linear models with normally distributed error to downweight the infuence of a small number of outlying specimens.”*

We could re-estimate them using a Bayesian analysis with priors, but we are reluctant to do so.
We have not done this before for conversion of commercial mean lengths to weight, or for any of the data streams, which have been peer reviewed twice through CSAS.
The length-weight relationship is one of the least uncertain parts of the assessment, compared to many other uncertainties.

However, we should be updating the length-weight parameters to include more recent data.
Therefore we have updated the length-weight model, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-LWfit-3cd).

The fits for males and females were nearly identical so we fit the model again with data for both males and females combined (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-LWfit-3cd-both)).
The updated length-weight parameters are `r paste0("$a = ", lwa, "$")` and `r paste0("$b = ", lwb, "$")`. 
This compares to `r paste0("$a = ", .ALPHA, "$")` and `r paste0("$b = ", .BETA, "$")` used in the previous two assessments.
 
We ran a version of the model based on Sc. 1 in the TWG Report, with the updated length-weight parameters. 
The MPD fit to the mean weight index, generated with updated length-weight parameters, is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-mean-weight-3cd-new-lw).
There was very little sensitivity in posterior model estimates of both recruitment (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-recr-3cd-new-lw)) and biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-biomass-3cd-new-lw)).
However, as for other data streams, the length-weight parameters will be updated for all scenarios in the  Science Response.

**Comment 2a ii.** I don’t fully understand Figure 12, but it only makes sense to me if there is a wide spread of measured weights for each calculated weight. 
The spread is quite large for weights in the 3-4 kg range which may lead to bias. Perhaps we should see a residual plot from Figure 12 to better understand the relationship between the observed and calculated mean weights. 

**Response:**

Figure 12 was the plot of individual fish weights calculated from the length-weight relationship (Eq. 1 in the TWG Report) vs the directly measured observed weights (reproduced here as Figure \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights)).
To illustrate residuals, we fit a simple linear model in natural log space (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-log-lm)).
Residuals are shown as histogram and points in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-log-resid-hist) and \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-log-resid-point), respectively.

**Comment 2b.** I accept that this is the procedure used for the commercial mean weights as well, but we have an opportunity to better understand potential bias this procedure may be introducing. 
Also, I think that the uncertainty in both sets of calculations of mean weight should be included in the transformation.

**Response:**

We're not sure what is meant by "the uncertainty in both sets of calculations of mean weight should be included in the transformation".

Regarding potential bias, we looked at the number of available fish weights that were measured directly (observed), compared to the number of fish weights calculated from length data using Eq. 1 in the TWG Report.
In total, across all survey years, there were `r nwobs` observed weights and `r nwcalc` calculated weights, i.e., a difference of `r nwdiff` specimens (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-counts)).

To investigate possible bias introduced by using the calculated weights, the survey annual mean weight index was re-calculated using the directly-measured (observed) weights, with very little effect on the index (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-index-compare)).

```{r fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-counts, fig.cap="Annual comparison of the number of observed vs. calculated weights from the WCVI survey.", out.width="4in", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("data/generated/Measured_v_Calc_weights_counts_3CD.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(here("data/generated/Survey_annual_mean_weight_compare_3CD.png"))
```


**Comment 2c. Eq. 2.** I assume that the sample ID is a survey tow? can there be more than one sample taken from a single tow? If so, shouldn’t they be combined?

**Response:**

We checked the database and there were no cases where there was more than one sample ID associated with a fishing event ID (tow).


**Comment 2d. Figure 13.** It would be better if you indicated the survey years with a data point and avoided connecting the points between survey years. That way you avoid the problem with the 2007 commercial mean weight lying below an interpolated mean weight from the survey which never existed.

**Response:**

We have updated the plot (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-index-compare-2)).

```{r fig-meas-vs-calc-index-compare-2, fig.cap="Commercial mean weight index and survey mean weight index. Area of the black open circles indicates the number of sampling events. To aid visualization, the commercial mean weight index is truncated to begin in 2000.", out.width="4in", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("data/generated/Comm_v_Survey_weights_3CD_2.png"))
```


**Comment 2e.** While I take your point that the GLM model performed adequately for most years, it failed quite badly in both 2012 and 2016, where both observed values lie well outside of the model credibility envelope.
My understanding of this model is that it is basically a simple regression without attempting any additional explanatory power.
Would it be possible to include in the model some spatial information, such as the number of tows in 3C or 3D (among both the survey and the commercial data) that might improve the predictive capacity of the model? Or depth information?

**Response:**

## Section 3. Model results

**Comment 3a.** While the four scenarios modelled in Section 2.3 seem reasonable, the actual model is obviously very insensitive to the different scenarios (as can be seen in Figures 8 and 9).
While I appreciate the need to use the delay-difference model (having made the same choice myself), I am afraid that it doesn’t do a very convincing job of using the mean weight data.
The lack of sensitivity to these mean weight scenarios leads one to the conclusion that worrying about the mean weight information is not very productive given the current model.
The model appears to be responsive to the biomass indices but Figure 8 indicates that while there is some recruitment variation among the four mean weight scenarios, it makes little difference to the biomass trends in Figure 9.

**Response:**

The model has never provided a great fit to the mean weight index, especially prior to the introduction of at-sea monitoring in 1996 [@forrest2020].
However, it does provide a good fit after 2012, especially the last five years (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-3cd)).
As we noted in the TWG report, the pattern in the last five years is consistent with predicted recruitment for all four of the scenarios, which very consistently estimated low recruitment between 2016 and 2018 (Figure 8 of the TWG report).
A population with fewer than average recruits is expected to have a higher than average mean weight of individuals.
The models estimated an increase in recruitment between 2019 and 2022, which would explain the subsequent estimated decline in commercial mean weight.

We agree that the model is fairly insensitive to the last five years of the mean weight index in relation to the other data sources (see the TWG report), due to the strong signal coming from the fishery-dependent and independent indices of abundance and the catch data.
The role of the commercial annual mean weight index was explored in 2018 assessment [@forrest2020; their Figure 91], showing it played an important role in scaling the model, but that the trends were largely driven by the other data sources.

**Comment 3b.** Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7: would it be possible to see a time series of residuals to the mean weight fits? 

**Response:**

Residuals (observed minus estimated values) are provided in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-resid-1) to  \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-resid-4).
Scenario numbers refer to those in the TWG Report.

**Comment 3c.** The MCMC traces in Figure 21 are not very persuasive. Nor are the autocorrelation plots. perhaps try longer chains and more burn-in?

**Response:**

We ran chains of length 5 million for the purposes of the TWG Report but we will use 10 million for the Science Response, as in the previous assessments.
However, we note that the the potential scale reduction statistics ($\hat{R}$ close to 1) [@gelman1992; @rstan2018] were consistent with convergence  (TWG Report, Table 9).

**Comment 3d.** Figure 26: the years need to be alternated so we can read them.

**Response:**

We will correct the axes in the Science Response (see Fig \@ref(fig:fig-sens11-index-cpue-post1995-3cd)).

```{r fig-sens11-index-cpue-post1995-3cd, fig.cap="MPD index fits showing sensitivity to the four commercial mean weight scenarios, commercial CPUE post-1995."}

```

## Section 4. Sensitivity to mean weight data

**Comment 4a.** I agree with the choice of mean weight Scenario #1, given the lack of sensitivity by this model to these data.
However, I think we should pursue some investigation to understand this lack of sensitivity to the mean weight data, and perhaps consider an alternative parameterisation of this model.
Or a different model.
Right now, it seems to me that we basically have a surplus production model, which may be the best we can do under the circumstances.

**Response:**

The last five data points in Scenario 1, which represent the only difference between this model and the previously peer-reviewed models, are consistent with other data sources, including fishery-dependent and independent surveys and the catch data, which indicate a period of low recruitment prior to 2018, when the survey index fell to one of the lowest points in its history and has remained low.
Consequently, the model fits these points very well (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-3cd)).

The only mechanism we have to adjust the fit to the annual mean weight data in this model is via the standard deviation parameter $\sigma_W$, which controls the closeness of the fit to the annual mean weight index.
As noted above, the effect of this parameter was explored in the 2018 stock assessment [@forrest2020; their Figure 91].
Decreasing the value of $\sigma_W$ from 0.2 to 0.15 resulted in a slight increase in estimated biomass, while doubling $\sigma_W$, or removing the pre-1996 annual mean weight index althogether, resulted in a notable downscaling of estimated biomass.
Subsequent unpublished tests of further decreasing $\sigma_W$ resulted in much better fits to the pre-1996 annual mean weight index (which is known to be biased high) and scaling up of the estimated biomass.
Given the bias in the pre-1996 length data, we are reluctant to further decrease $\sigma_W$.

TODO: Update above text when new scenarios are ready.

# Conclusions and next steps

We agree that the annual mean weight index is, and has always been, problematic for Pacific Cod assessments, and we agree that other models and methods for delivering advice should be explored.
However, this is out of scope for the 2023 Science Response and, given that this model has been peer-reviewed twice for Area 3CD, it is currently the best available science for providing timely advice for this stock.
Given the three very low survey index points in 2018, 2020 and 2021, a timely stock status update is needed.

As noted in Comment 3a, there is probably not much more fruitful exploration that can be done with the annual mean weight index.
The GLM presented in the TWG Report showed a very strong relationship between the commercial and survey annual mean weight indices.
The Scenario 1 values derived from the survey annual mean weight index are consistent with other data sources and the model fits them well.
Given this, we recommend proceeding with the 2023 Science Response based on Scenario 1, with the following updates:

1. Update the length-weight parameters in all scenarios;

2. For consistency with the commercial index and to gain a larher sample size, continue to use the calculated weights from lengths in the survey annual mean weight index. 
This is justified, given very little difference in the index to the index based on the observed weights;

3. Continue to exclude the 2017 annual mean weight index point;

4. Use an MCMC chain length of 10 million in all models, as for previous assessments; 

5. Include a short appendix describing development of the survey annual mean weight index, the GLM, and the sensitivity analyses; and

6. Update plots and correct typographical errors as suggested.

Going forward, the loss of commercial biological samples from the commercial trawl fishery threatens the long-term viability of the current delay-difference model as a primary tool for assessing BC Pacific Cod populations.
Given the poor predictive power of the GLM for predicting a commercial mean weight index for the Area 5ABCD stock (unpublished 2022 TWG Report), there is already no clear path forward for that stock.
Therefore, in the absence of resuming a full commercial biological sampling program, we recommend resources be allocated to investigating and comparing other approaches for providing catch advice for Pacific Cod stocks.
This may include length-based [e.g., @haist1995; @haist1998] or production model [e.g., @mildenberger2019] methods or an even more data-limited approach, such as adjusting annual TACs based on changes in the survey indices.
Versions of the latter approach are used by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) for data-limited (Category 3) stocks [@ices2022].
In Canada, survey-based data-limited methods have been simulation-tested in the Groundfish Management Procedure Framework [@anderson2021] and in @huynh2020.

Any future model-development work should be done in response to a Request for Science Information and Advice, either from the Groundfish Management Unit or from Science, and should be done via the CSAS process.
We recommend holding separate peer-review processes for the methodolgy and for the provision of advice (e.g., follow a "Benchmark" process similar to that followed by ICES; or a "Framework" process followed by DFO in the Maritimes region).

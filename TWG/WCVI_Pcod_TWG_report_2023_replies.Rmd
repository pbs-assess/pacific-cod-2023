## Section 1. 2017 index point

**Comment 1a. Section 2.1.5.** There is a contradiction in the 2nd paragraph in this section; it states “In Area 3CD, only four samples were taken in 2017 (total 300 fish), no samples were taken in 2018, and only two samples were taken in 2019 (total 360 fish). 
The 2017 mean weight value was anomalously high (3.024 kg) and, given that it was only based on two samples, it was not used in the 2020 stock assessment update (DFO 2021).
Due to lack of data, the 2020 assessment used the 2019 mean weight value for both 2019 and 2020, although this was not ideal, as the 2019 index point was also based on only two samples.” 
But according to Table 8, the 2017 sample was based on 4 samples, not 2. 

**Response:**

This was a typo that will be corrected in the Science Response.

**Comment 1b.** While I sympathise with excluding the 2017 estimate, dropping it simply because it was too high is potentially not a sound response. 

**Response:**

Since this Science Response will be an update, we made this choice to be consistent with the 2020 advice [@dfo2021].

However, we have run a scenario based on Sc. 1 in the TWG Report that includes the 2017 value.
Comparisons of the model fit to the annual mean weight index in Sc. 1 (without 2017) and Sc. 2 (with 2017) are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-3cd) and \@ref(fig:fig-mean-weight-3cd-2017).
The model does not fit the 2017 value, similarly missing it and other very high mean weight index values.
As noted in previous Pacific Cod assessments, the model in general does not fit the mean weight index very well, especially in the early part of the time series where smaller fish are underrepresented in the data, which includes mainly fish classified as "keepers" [@forrest2015].

The four samples collected in 2017, and the two samples collected in 2019, were collected from a limited area (see Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sample-locations)). The 2019 samples were collected from a single vessel.
In 2017, only 300 fish were measured across all four samples.
Given the obvious problems with basing index points on such limited samples, we don't think it is justified to further explore changing model parameters to fit the 2017 data point.
Unpublished trials with smaller values of $\sigma_W$, the observation error term that influences the fit to the mean weight index, have resulted in much closer fits to the data in the early part of the time series, accompanied by a rescaling of the biomass, which we also feel is problematic due to the lack of small fish prior to 1996 [@forrest2015].

## Section 2. Appendix B: Survey mean weight index

**Comment 2a i. Eq. 1.** Since this is a Bayesian analysis, shouldn’t we be including some uncertainty in the conversion of length to weight?

**Response:**

The length-weight parameter parameters were estimates taken directly from the 2018 Pacific cod update [@forrest2020]:

*“The models were fit as robust linear regressions: ln(Ws) = ln(a) + b · ln(Ls) with an M estimator (Venables and Ripley 2002). Robust linear models were chosen over linear models with normally distributed error to downweight the infuence of a small number of outlying specimens.”*

We could re-estimate them using a Bayesian analysis with priors, but we are reluctant to do so.
We have not done this before for conversion of commercial mean lengths to weight, or for any of the data streams, which have been peer reviewed twice through CSAS.
The length-weight relationship is one of the least uncertain parts of the assessment, compared to many other uncertainties.

However, we should be updating the length-weight parameters to include more recent data.
Therefore we have updated the length-weight model, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-LWfit-3cd).

The fits for males and females were nearly identical so we fit the model again with data for both males and females combined (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-LWfit-3cd-both)).
The updated length-weight parameters are `r paste0("$a = ", lwa, "$")` and `r paste0("$b = ", lwb, "$")`. 
This compares to `r paste0("$a = ", .ALPHA, "$")` and `r paste0("$b = ", .BETA, "$")` used in the previous two assessments.
 
We ran a version of the model based on Sc. 1 in the TWG Report, except with the updated length-weight parameters. 
The MPD fit to the mean weight index generated with updated length-weight parameters is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-mean-weight-3cd-new-lw).
There was very little sensitivity to posterior model estimates of both recruitment (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-recr-3cd-new-lw)) and biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-biomass-3cd-new-lw)).
However, the length-weight parameters will be updated for all scenarios in the  Science Response.

**Comment 2a ii.** I don’t fully understand Figure 12, but it only makes sense to me if there is a wide spread of measured weights for each calculated weight. 
The spread is quite large for weights in the 3-4 kg range which may lead to bias. Perhaps we should see a residual plot from Figure 12 to better understand the relationship between the observed and calculated mean weights. 

**Response:**

Figure 12 was the plot of individual fish weights calculated from the length-weight relationship vs the directly measured observed weights (reproduced here as Figure \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights)).
To illustrate residuals, we fit a simple linear model in natural log space (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-log-lm)).
Residuals are shown as histogram and points in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-log-resid)).

**Comment 2b.** I accept that this is the procedure used for the commercial mean weights as well, but we have an opportunity to better understand potential bias this procedure may be introducing. 
Also, I think that the uncertainty in both sets of calculations of mean weight should be included in the transformation.

**Response:**

We're not sure what is meant by "the uncertainty in both sets of calculations of mean weight should be included in the transformation".

Regarding potential bias, we looked at the number of available fish weights that were measured directly (observed), compared to the number of fish weights calculated from length data using Eq. 1.
In total, across all survey years, there were `r nwobs` observed weights and `r nwcalc` calculated weights, i.e., a difference of `r nwdiff` specimens (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-counts)).

To investigate possible bias introduced by using the calculated weights, the survey annual mean weight index was re-calculated using the directly-measured (observed) weights, with very little effect on the index (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-index-compare)).

```{r fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-counts, fig.cap="Comparison of observed vs. calculated weights from the WCVI survey; all years, all depth strata.", out.width="4in", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("data/generated/Measured_v_Calc_weights_residuals_counts_3CD.png"))
```


```{r fig-meas-vs-calc-index-compare, fig.cap="Comparison of the survey annual mean weight index calculated with observed weights and with calculated weights", out.width="4in", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("data/generated/Survey_annual_mean_weight_compare_3CD.png"))
```


**Comment 2c. Eq. 2.** I assume that the sample ID is a survey tow? can there be more than one sample taken from a single tow? If so, shouldn’t they be combined?

**Response:**

We checked the database and there were no cases where there was more than one sample ID associated with a fishing event ID (tow).


**Comment 2d. Figure 13.** It would be better if you indicated the survey years with a data point and avoided connecting the points between survey years. That way you avoid the problem with the 2007 commercial mean weight lying below an interpolated mean weight from the survey which never existed.

**Response:**

TODO

**Comment 2e.** While I take your point that the GLM model performed adequately for most years, it failed quite badly in both 2012 and 2016, where both observed values lie well outside of the model credibility envelope.
My understanding of this model is that it is basically a simple regression without attempting any additional explanatory power.
Would it be possible to include in the model some spatial information, such as the number of tows in 3C or 3D (among both the survey and the commercial data) that might improve the predictive capacity of the model? Or depth information?

**Response:**

TODO

## Section 3. Model results

**Comment 3a.** While the four scenarios modelled in Section 2.3 seem reasonable, the actual model is obviously very insensitive to the different scenarios (as can be seen in Figures 8 and 9).
While I appreciate the need to use the delay-difference model (having made the same choice myself), I am afraid that it doesn’t do a very convincing job of using the mean weight data.
The lack of sensitivity to these mean weight scenarios leads one to the conclusion that worrying about the mean weight information is not very productive given the current model.
The model appears to be responsive to the biomass indices but Figure 8 indicates that while there is some recruitment variation among the four mean weight scenarios, it makes little difference to the biomass trends in Figure 9.

**Response:**

TODO

**Comment 3b.** Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7: would it be possible to see a time series of residuals to the mean weight fits? 

**Response:**

TODO

**Comment 3c.** The MCMC traces in Figure 21 are not very persuasive. nor are the autocorrelation plots. perhaps try longer chains and more burn-in?

**Response:**

TODO

**Comment 3d.** Figure 26: the years need to be alternated so we can read them.

**Response:**

TODO

## Section 4. Likelihood

**Comment 4a.** I agree with the choice of mean weight Scenario #1, given the lack of sensitivity by this model to these data.
However, I think we should pursue some investigation to understand this lack of sensitivity to the mean weight data, and perhaps consider an alternative parameterisation of this model.
Or a different model.
Right now, it seems to me that we basically have a surplus production model, which may be the best we can do under the circumstances.

**Response:**

TODO

# Context

The last assessment for Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) in British Columbia (BC) was completed in 2020 [@dfo2021]. 
Fishery-independent synoptic bottom trawl surveys are conducted biennially in BC, usually occurring in even-numbered years for West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI). 
However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the scheduled 2020 WCVI survey did not occur.
The 2018 survey index for WCVI was very low, at approximately 26--27% of the magnitude of the 2014 and 2016 observations. 
An interim survey was conducted in 2021, and the regular WCVI survey was conducted in 2022. Both the 2021 and 2022 survey points were of similar low magnitude to that in 2018 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-summary-indices-3cd); Table (tab: surv-canadian-table))

The commercial catch  per unit effort (CPUE) index has also decreased since 2016 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-summary-indices-3cd)).
Catches in 2018 and 2019 in Area 3CD were also much lower than previous years (Table \@ref(tab:tab-catch-3cd), Figure \@ref(fig:fig-catch-3cd)). 

The stock assessment is a delay-difference model [@deriso1980], fit to commercial and survey indices of abundance, commercial catch and an index of commercial mean weight, which is derived from commercial length samples [see @forrest2020 for methodology].
The commercial mean weight index provides information about recruitment strength to the model.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent shift towards at-sea electronic monitoring, there has been no at-sea biological sampling on commercial trawl vessels since 2019. 

However, even before the pandemic, there had been a decline in commercial sampling of Pacific cod since 2015 (Appendix A). In Area 3CD, only four samples were taken in 2017 (total 300 fish), no samples were taken in 2018, and only two samples were taken in 2019 (total 360 fish). The 2017 mean weight value was anomalously high (3.024 kg) and, given that it was only based on two samples, it was not used in the 2020 stock assessment update [@dfo2021]. 
The 2020 assessment update used the 2019 mean weight value for both 2019 and 2020 for both the Area 3CD and the Area 5ABCD (Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound) stocks [@dfo2021].

A request for science advice for Pacific Cod was issued in 2022 for both the 3CD and 5ABCD stocks. The request had two steps: 1) an evaluation to assess the potential sensitivity of the stock assessment to missing length data from the commercial fishery; and 2) update the status of both stocks.
The request advised only to proceed to Step 2 if the missing length data were "deemed to not be of significance to the quality and rigour of the scientific advice".
Using the 2020 assessment model, the authors presented several sensitivity analyses to the Pacific Cod Technical Working Group (TWG) to show the potential effects of the loss of commercial length samples on predicted stock status.
Analyses found that the 2020 Area 3CD model was sensitive to the removal of the last three years of the mean weight index [unpublished].
Following this finding, the TWG met again and evaluated a generalized linear model (GLM) for predicting the commercial mean weight index from a mean weight index derived from survey samples. 
The TWG found that the GLM provided a reasonable prediction of the commercial mean weight index for Area 3CD.
The GLM did not have acceptable predictive power for the 5ABCD stock.

Given the ongoing very low catches of Area 3CD Pacific Cod and model predictions of very low fishing mortality [@dfo2021], the Pacific Groundfish Management Unit did not request updated catch advice for 2023.
However, given the three low index points in 2018, 2021 and 2022, Science has requested a stock status update to ensure all three of these index points are considered in the timely evaluation of stock status.

This Science Response reports results from the Science Response Process of December 2022 on the Stock Status Update of British Columbia Pacific Cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) in Area 3CD in 2023.
The update uses the same model configurations as the 2020 assessment [@dfo2021], including model-averaged stock status based on the same seven sensitivity analyses as in 2020.
The commercial mean weight index is derived from the GLM presented to the TWG in 2022.

We use the survey mean weight index to predict the commercial mean weight index for only the last five years of the assessment so that we can have a continuous mean weight index for the entire model period, beginning in 1956.

# Methods

## Data

*TODO: Summarise sampling effort (see Appendix A of first 2022 TWG report)*

## Modelling steps

For Area 3CD only, we took the following steps:

Step 1. Develop a survey mean weight index (see Appendix B for methods and results);

Step 2. Use a generalized linear regression model (GLM) with a log link to predict commercial mean weight from survey mean weight (see Appendix C for methods and results);

Step 3. Update model data files with predicted commercial mean weight index values for 2018-2022, noting that predicted commercial mean weight index values are only available for years in which there was a survey (i.e., predicted values are generated only for survey years 2018, 2021 and 2022).

Evaluate four alternative scenarios that differ only in treatment of the last four years of mean weight data (see next section).

Step 4. Run the models and evaluate sensitivity of model results to the updated commercial mean weight indices.

Step 5. Select the best mean weight index scenario (based on model diagnostics and TWG consensus) to use in the seven sensitivity cases for model-averaging and update the data files accordingly.

Step 5. Run the seven sensitivity models for model averaging and report stock status.


## Model scenarios: Sensitivity to mean weight 

The four sensitivity cases differ in terms of the treatment of the mean weight index for the years 2018--2022. 
All scenarios used the commercial mean weight index for the years 1956--2016, noting that there was no 2017 index point, as in the 2020 assessment.



We note that commercial mean weights are only predicted from the GLM for years when there was a survey. There are therefore gaps in the predicted commercial mean weight index for 2019 and 2020. There was a WCVI survey in 2018, but no survey in 2020. Therefore, for the 2018-2020 period of interest, there was only a *predicted* commercial mean weight index point in 2018. We ran two alternative scenarios. **Scenario 1:** values for 2019 and 2020 were obtained by linear interpolation between the 2018 and 2021 predicted values; and **Scenario 2:** we used only the 2018 value. We used the `approx` function in R for the linear interpolation, in natural space.

For all model runs, the joint posterior distribution was numerically approximated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routines built into AD Model Builder (Metropolis-Hastings algorithm) [@fournier2012]. Posterior samples were drawn every 2,500 iterations from a chain of length 5 million, resulting in 2,000 posterior samples (the first 1,000 samples were dropped to allow for sufficient burn-in).

## Model-averaged stock status



# Results

## Data

Commercial mean weight values used in the model scenarios are provided in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-mean-weight-recent-3cd) and \@ref(tab:tab-mean-weight-recent-5abcd). 

## Model scenarios: Sensitivity to mean weight 

Maximum posterior density (MPD) model fits to the commercial mean weight index from the Reference Case model and Scenarios 1 and 2 are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-3cd) to \@ref(fig:fig-base-mean-weight-3cd-sc2). As in previous assessments [@forrest2020], model fits to the mean weight index in all scenarios were generally poor, with the models tending to underestimate observed mean weight, especially in the earlier part of the time series. 

Posterior biomass estimates from the Reference Case model are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-model-ref-biomass-3cd). Compared to this model, Scenarios 1 and 2 resulted in reduced estimates of biomass for 2019-2020 and a reduced 2021 forecast (Table \@ref(tab:tab-est-biomass-3cd); Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-biomass-3cd)). The percentage change for the median 2021 forecast biomass ranged from -24.5% in Scenario 1 to -15.8% in Scenario 2 (Table \@ref(tab:tab-est-biomass-3cd-per)). Median posterior estimates of recruitment were much lower in 2019-2020 in Scenarios 1 and 2 compared to the Reference Case, with the percentage change ranging from -53.9% in Scenario 1 to -27.8% in Scenario 2 (Table \@ref(tab:tab-est-recruit-3cd); Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sens-recr-3cd)). We note that biases were larger in Scenario 1, where interpolation was applied, than in Scenario 2, where it was not.

The lower estimates of 2019-2020 recruitment in Scenarios 1 and 2, compared to the Reference Case model, especially in Scenario 1, are mostly likely driven by the higher mean weights in 2018-2020 (Table \@ref(tab:tab-mean-weight-recent-3cd)), which would imply fewer small fish in the catch, all other things equal. 

Clearly from Tables \@ref(tab:tab-est-biomass-3cd-per) and \@ref(tab:tab-est-recruit-3cd), recruitment estimates are more strongly influenced by the mean weight index than biomass estimates, which are more directly influenced by catch and indices of abundance. However, given the short lifespan of Pacific cod in BC (~10-11 years) and the assumed early age of maturity in the models (2 years), changes in estimates of recruitment are expected to impact estimates of biomass relatively quickly. 

## Model-averaged stock status



# Conclusions

We were able to derive a catch-weighted survey mean weight index for each area. We were able to derive a predicted commercial mean weight index from the survey mean weight index. The survey mean weight index was a better predictor of the commercial mean weight index in Area 3CD, compared to Area 5ABCD.

The effects of the two alternative treatments in each area were stronger for Area 3CD than for Area 5ABCD, especially for recruitment. This was because the last observed 2019 mean weight index value used in the Reference Case model was much lower (~0.5-1.0 kg lower) than the values used for 2018-2020 in Scenarios 1 and 2. The larger perceived bias in Area 3CD should be considered in light of the fact that the 2019 and 2020 commercial mean weight values used in the 2020 Reference Case model were based on only two samples. Given the apparent strong relationship between the survey and fishery prior to 2016 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd)), the predicted commercial mean weight index may represent more realistic values.

The results of this exercise highlight obvious differences in selectivity between the commercial fishery and synoptic surveys, especially in Area 5ABCD, where the survey catches much smaller fish. This represents a violation of the assumptions of the delay-difference model, which assumes knife-edged selectivity in both the survey and fishery. However, violation of this assumption is probably less consequential than the assumption of the same knife-edged maturity. As long as the relative selectivities in the survey and fishery remain approximately constant, calibration exercises such as this may be an acceptable approach to continue the time series of the commercial mean weight index, although this should be evaluated through simulation-testing.

# Developing a survey mean weight index {#sec:AppendixB}

## Methods

We followed the steps in Appendix C of @forrest2020, which described the methodology for weighting the commercial length samples to produce a commercial mean weight index, weighted by sequential quarter and catch weight. 
We also adapted the approach for the West Coast Vancouver Island Synoptic Survey by replacing weighting by sequential quarter, which was done for the commercial samples, with weighting by depth stratum (Equations 3 and 4).
This was done because the survey is depth-stratified.

Note that for the survey mean weight index, we derived weights of individual fish from the measured lengths, using published length-weight parameters rather than using weights that were directly measured (Equation 1).
This was because far more fish were measured than were weighed.
This also follows the approach used for the commercial mean weight index.

The calculation of the survey annual mean weight index was done in the following steps. For simplicity, we have dropped year subscripts.

1. For each specimen $i$, in each Sample ID $j$, in each depth stratum $s$, convert individual length ($L_{i,j,s}$)  to weight ($W_{i,j,s}$):

\begin{equation}
{W_{i,j,s}} = \alpha{L_{i,j,s}}^{\beta}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constant length-weight parameters, where the values of the length-weight parameters are `r paste0("$\\alpha = ", .ALPHA3, "$")` and `r paste0("$\\beta = ", .BETA3, "$")`.

2. Calculate the mean weight ($W_j$) in each sample ID $j$, in each depth stratum $s$:

\begin{equation}
  {W_{j,s}} =  \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{j,s}}{{w_{i,j,s}}}}{{N_{j,s}}}
\end{equation}

where $N_{j,s}$ is the number of weights $W_{i,j,s}$ in sample ID $j$ and depth stratum $s$.

3. Calculate the mean weight ($W_s$) for each depth stratum $s$, weighted by the sample weights $S$:

\begin{equation}
{W_s} = \frac{{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{{N_s}} {{W_{j,s}S_{j,s}}}}}{{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{{N_s}} {{S_{j,s}}}}}
\end{equation}

where $N_s$ is the number of samples in depth stratum $s$.

4. Calculate the annual survey mean weight ($W$), weighted by the catch $C_s$ in each stratum $s$:

\begin{equation}
{W} = \frac{{\sum\limits_{s=1}^{{K}} {{W_sC_s}}}}{{\sum\limits_{s=1}^{{K}} {{C_s}}}}
\end{equation}

where $K$ is the number of depth strata surveyed in that year.

## Results

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-meas-vs-calc-weights-3cd) shows the relationship between observed weights obtained by directly weighing individual fish vs weights calculated using Equation 1.
Figure \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd) shows the commercial mean weight index obtained from the methods described in @forrest2020, compared with the survey mean weight index obtained from Equations 1--4.
Figure \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd-2) shows the commercial mean weight index plotted against with the survey mean weight index, with a linear regression line.
The number of sampling events is indicated by the sizes of the circles in Figures \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd) and \@ref(fig:fig-comm-vs-survey-weights-3cd-2).

# Generalized Linear Model to predict commercial mean length index {#sec:AppendixC}

## Methods

We used a simple GLM with a Gamma log link function, to estimate model fit of commercial mean weights ($y_t$) in year $t$ to the log survey mean weights ($W_t$), calculated in Appendix A:

\begin{align}
{y_t} \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\phi / \mu_t, \phi), \\
\log(\mu_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(W_t) 
\end{align}

where the $\phi$ parameter contributes to both the rate and shape of the Gamma distribution.

Using the `predict` function in R, we then used the model to predict commercial mean weights from available survey mean weights.

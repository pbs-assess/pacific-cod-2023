# Context

This document provides replies to a second set of minor comments received from the Pacific Cod Technical Working Group (TWG) on the report *"Alternative treatments of the commercial annual mean weight index for the West Coast Vancouver Island stock of Pacific Cod. Report for the Technical Working Group"* (hereafter, the "TWG Report"; attached).

We received one final comment recommending we look at model sensitivity to the 2019 commercial annual mean weight index point, which had been included in the 2020 stock assessment update.
This index point was based on only two samples (n = 360 fish; see Appendix A of the TWG Report), collected by the same vessel in almost exactly the same location (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sample-locations)).
Therefore, we recommended replacing this index point with an interpolated value from the GLM (see the TWG Report).
Here, we present three other scenarios to evaluate model sensitivity to treatment of the 2019 index point:

* Scenario 1e: Same as Scenario 1 from the TWG Report (i.e., use GLM values from 2018--2022), but exclude the interpolated value from 2019.

* Scenario 1f: Same as Scenario 1e but also exclude the GLM value from 2018.

* Scenario 1g: Exclude the 2018 and 2019 GLM values, and replace with the original value used in the 2020 stock assessment update.

Values used in Scenario 1 and the three scenarios above are summarized in Table \@ref(tab: tab-mean-weight-recent-3cd).
